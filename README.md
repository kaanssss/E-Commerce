Project Description: This SwiftUI and Firebase based e-commerce application offers a modern and innovative shopping experience that allows users to discover, review and easily order fashion products.

Firebase Integration: User login, registration and authentication processes are managed with Firebase Authentication. Product data is provided and updated in real time using Firestore. Firestore also securely stores user information and order history.

Navigation System: A simple and fluid navigation system optimized with SwiftUI's NavigationStack structure is presented. Users can log in to the application quickly and effectively with Splash and Onboarding screens. Session status is dynamically monitored and guidance is provided according to login requirements.

Product Discovery: Users can filter products by category under popular brands such as Nike, Adidas and Puma and make detailed product reviews. Dynamic product list provides up-to-date product information to the user with constantly updated Firestore data.

Advanced Animation and Transitions: Animations and transition effects that enrich the user experience are used at every step of the app, creating a modern feel. Smooth transitions are provided from splash screen to product details.
